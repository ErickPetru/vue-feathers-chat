# vue-feathers-chat

> A sample realtime chat made with Vue and Feathers

## About

This project is a sample public chat, visually almost like a WhatsApp clone, which uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org) for the _frontend_ and [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com/) for the _backend_. The communication between server and client happens with [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/). The messages are saved in JSON format with the [NeDB](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/nedb-a-lightweight-javascript-database-using) database, a lightweight _MongoDB_ inspired database, simple and good for small samples and prototyping.

## Quick Start

Be up and running with four easy steps.

1. Download this repository wherever you want
2. Ensure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed
2. Open the _terminal_ (or _prompt_ on Windows) and install the dependencies
    
    ```
    cd path/to/vue-feathers-chat
    npm install
    ```

3. Put the app to run on `http://localhost:3030/`:
